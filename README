[Python3] Youtube-Restriction Analyzer

###Gathers data from selected channels and prints out information

This program gathers all videos from selected channels and checks, if they are restricted.
After that all tags are gathered (takes a while and a bit of traffic) for all restricted and safe videos.

All tags occurring more than 10 times and their restriction rate are then put out to console and file.
